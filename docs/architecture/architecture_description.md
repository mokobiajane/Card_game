General Description

Card Game is a multi-player, turn-based card game developed in C++ that simulates classic card game mechanics. The game supports both human players and AI opponents. Initially designed for a command-line interface, the project is built with scalability in mind, enabling future extensions such as additional game modes, rule variations, and even graphical user interfaces.

 GAME OBJECTIVE:
- Engagement: Deliver a strategic and fun gameplay experience through interactive card mechanics.
- Flexibility: Support multiple players (human and AI) and enable various gameplay modes.
- Expandability: Provide a robust and modular codebase that can be easily extended with new features, such as advanced AI strategies or network multiplayer.
- Maintainability: Ensure a clean, well-documented repository structure to facilitate ongoing development and testing.

 SCOPE:
- Initial Focus: Implement core card game features such as deck management, player actions, turn-based gameplay, and rule enforcement.
- Future Enhancements: Introduce additional game modes, refine AI behavior, develop a graphical user interface, and incorporate networked multiplayer options.



 ~SYSTEM REQUIREMENT

 Functional Requirements
1. Deck Management:
   - Initialize a standard deck of cards with defined suits and ranks.
   - Enable shuffling of the deck and drawing cards.
2. Player Interaction:
   - Support multiple players, each with an individual hand.
   - Allow players to perform actions such as drawing, playing, and discarding cards.
3. Turn-Based Gameplay:
   - Enforce a strict turn order, updating game state based on player actions.
   - Track rounds and determine winning conditions (e.g., a player empties their hand or reaches a target score).
4. AI Integration:
   - Implement an AI module that makes decisions based on the current game state.
   - Allow seamless switching between human and AI players.
5. Documentation and Testing:
   - Include inline documentation (Doxygen-style) for all classes and methods.
   - Develop a suite of unit, integration, and system tests to validate game mechanics.

 Non-Functional Requirements
1. Performance:
   - The game should run smoothly on standard desktop hardware with minimal memory overhead.
2. Platform Compatibility:
   - Must compile and run on Windows, Linux, and macOS using standard C++17 (or later).
3. Maintainability:
   - Follow consistent naming conventions and modular design practices to ensure the codebase is clean and easily extensible.
4. User Interface:
   - Start with a command-line interface that clearly displays game state and prompts.
   - Design the architecture to allow for a future transition to a graphical interface without major refactoring.
